# Accessing the monitor


You must follow these instructions to access the screens that will let you set up the monitor.   The internet address printed on the monitor is for seeing if it works, **not** part of the set up procedure.

```{admonition} Tip
:class: Tip
Try these instructions at home with a cup of tea before taking the monitor to your community building.  That way you'll be relaxed with a bit more time and already know where the wifi works well.
