# Accessing the monitor


You must follow these instructions to access the screens that will let you set up the monitor.   The internet address printed on the monitor is **not** part of the set up procedure.

:class: Tip
Try these instructions at home with a cup of tea before taking the monitor to your community building.  That way you'll be relaxed with a bit more time and already know where the wifi works well.
