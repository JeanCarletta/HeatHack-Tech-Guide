# Starting the monitor

If you chose "save" mode, you will now see this screen:

:align: center
```

The monitor **always** downloads whatever data it has on it when you use this screen - there is no way to restart the device without going through this step.  You should download the data and restart the device every time you move the monitor and at least every three weeks, as otherwise it will run out of space and stop saving data.

```{admonition}  Important

Don't turn the thermal monitor off at the switch without downloading the data first.  The monitor is so cheap it doesn't have a good clock in it; we rely on the time that you downloaded the data being close to the time of the last reading collected in order to make the times more accurate when we receive them.  If you find your building's occupants fiddle with the switch, put tape over it.  You can turn it off and on by sliding the lid off and removing and reinserting a battery instead.

If you need to, you can take the monitor home **still running** and get the data off it at leisure, keeping it on until you take it back.  It helps to note down when you moved the monitor but it's usually obvious from the data.  If you want to save the battery, t's OK to get the data off at home and then turn the monitor off immediately.  In this case, just before you go back to the venue, turn the monitor on, download the data and start the device, and then you can throw away the file you downloaded.  

```

Where it says "Enter the location", enter a text string that will help you remember where the monitor was when the data was collected.  It's helpful if this is the same string every time the monitor is in the same place.  Please avoid using spaces.  You can use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead. Then click on "Get data and start".

Until we automate our processing, there is a risk we will lose information about where you placed the monitor.  We suggest you use our diary template for recording monitor movements until we get this sorted.
