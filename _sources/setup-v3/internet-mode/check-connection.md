# Check for data

If you've used the wifi in this building before, your device might automatically connect to it again and give you internet access, but if not, you'll need to use your wifi settings to
connect manually.

Check for data by using your web browser's address bar to visit the thingspeak address written on the outside of your monitor.

Your ThingSpeak page might look a bit different as we have to set up each one by hand and don't always remember.

The page has read-out of the most recent temperature received along with how long ago ThingSpeak received it.  If you have only just turned the monitor off and on, this should be recent.  It can sometimes take a while for the readings to appear so be patient. We are clarifying the delay with the service provider.


If you don't see recent data on ThingSpeak, you probably entered the wrong password and will need to try again.
