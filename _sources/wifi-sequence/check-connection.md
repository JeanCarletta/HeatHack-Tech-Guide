To check that the hub is working, connect to the guest wifi network and use your browser to go to the thingspeak.com address printed on your box.  

You will see three very basic graphs - we will produce better ones later.  You should see a recent very low reading (1C and 1%RH).  If you don't see this, your hub didn't connect to the internet correctly.  You should also see some realistic temperature and relative humidity readings.  If you see the low reading and nothing after that, your sensor unit isn't managing to get data to the hub.

You can now leave the sensor unit and hub unattended.  If anyone turns them off, they will start working again when you turn them back on.  You may wish to leave a note at the power socket, as cleaners often turn hubs off and stick them in the lost and found.
