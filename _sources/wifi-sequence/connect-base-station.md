 Decide where to place the sensor unit, and plug in the hub not too far away in a socket that people don't need very often.   The hub has a blue LED just visible through the case that will flash once in case you need confirmation that the power is working. 
 
 On a phone or tablet, then find your wifi settings. You can access them through the settings icon (a gear) on your home screen or by searching.

In larger spaces, the radio works best if the arrow on the outside of the sensor unit points towards the hub.
