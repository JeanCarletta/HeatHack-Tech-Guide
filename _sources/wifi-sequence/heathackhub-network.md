The heathackhub network will appear.  Connect to it.  It is an open network and doesn't require a password. If you were already connected to a wifi network, this will disconnect you from that network.

Ignore any warnings about internet not being available - keep the wifi connection to the hub anyway. You will be unable to use the internet while you are connected to the hub.

```{admonition} Important

Once you are successful, you won't be able to see the heathackhub network again even if you turn the router off and on - because the hub will connect automatically to the internet instead.  You will only see the heathackhub network if you move out of wifi range.  The hub only stores the details for one wifi network at a time.
