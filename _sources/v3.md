# Setting up units sent April 2023 and after

In April 2023 we started posting out units that are easy to switch between standalone and internet-connected operation and that are always just in one, battery-operated piece with no need for a power socket.  We refer to these units as "v3" (version 3).

It may be that in a few cases we will ship out v1 or v2 units after this date.  In this case, we will tell you that you have an earlier version.
