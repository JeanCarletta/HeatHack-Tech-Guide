# Accessing the thermal monitoring data

If you have an internet-connected monitor and want to know if it is currently sending data to the internet or has been recently, you can view your ThingSpeak feed.  You need to know your venue number.  ThingSpeak saves all the data, but only gives public access to the last 2000 data points.

At least once a week, we copy the data to Github for better plotting and so that you can have easy access to download it for plotting in Excel if you wish.  Again, you need your venue number, this time to choose it from the dropdown list.  The download files are labelled by sensor "MAC address".  You can find the MAC adddress that corresponds to your venue in the venue keys file.
