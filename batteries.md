# Batteries

The sensor unit uses AA lithium batteries.  These are available, for instance, from Energizer.  This is the kind of battery used in things like smoke alarms. They are the same size and shape as ordinary alkaline AA batteries, but should last a year.  It is possible to use alkaline batteries, but their performance will be variable, lasting something between a week and a month.  

```{admonition} Safety
:class: important

* Do not attempt to recharge lithium batteries - these are not the same as the lithium-ion in your phone
* Don't leave them in very hot places
* Don't run battery-operated devices under things where heat can build up

These are the same safety tips as for alkaline batteries, but these batteries store more energy, so it's more important to remember them.
