# What the monitor does

Once you have set it up, the monitor will take temperature and relative humidity readings and send them to the internet immediately.  It will do it again after five minutes and then after another five minutes.  This is so you can check the monitor is working using ThingSpeak.  After this, the monitor will take readings every five minutes, but to save battery, it doesn't send them to the web instantly.  During the day (6 am to 6 pm), it saves up an hour worth of readings and sends them all at once.  At night, and also during the day if your wifi is very slow, it saves them up for 6 hours.  There's a further delay in that our website only checks for new data every four hours.  That means it can be 16 hours before the readings appear with the rest of your data on our website. 

You can re-check whether a monitor is still working at any time by turning it off, waiting 10 seconds, and turning it on again.  The monitor will wait for a minute to see if you want to connect to heathack-s but after that restart using the wifi connection details you entered when you set it up.
