```{admonition} Common error message

Some web browsers like Safari require secure communication by default.  Others give you the option to require it.  Our monitor isn't powerful enough to communicate securely.  If you get an error message about HTTP, HTTPS, or security, you will need to change your settings temporarily to allow HTTP connections while you set up the hub.
