If the sensor unit is already on, turn it off, wait ten seconds, then turn it on again.  A wifi hotspot named "engineer" will appear.  Connect to it using the password "heathack".  Ignore any warnings about internet availability - connect to the hotspot anyway.

You have around one minute to do this step and the next one but if you take longer, you can start again.
