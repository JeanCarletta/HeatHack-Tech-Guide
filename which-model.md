# Which model do I have?

We began shipping version 3 of the monitor in April 2023.  The v3 monitor comes as a single battery-operated unit that contains a white "checkerboard" sensor.  Previous models use a different set of instructions that are given at the end of this guide.

Version 3 monitors are a single black box with an on-off switch and space for two AA batteries with a white "checkerboard" sensor built into a hole cut into the box.

If your monitor comes in two pieces or has a wire aerial, unless we specifically tell you otherwise, it is a version 1 or version 2.  

If you are part of our supported Royal Academy of Engineering programme, have a version 1 or 2 monitor, and you have difficulty getting readings, get in touch as replacing it may give you better service.
