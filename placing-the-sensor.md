# Where to put the sensor unit

You want your sensor unit to reflect the experiences people have in your space, without being affected by local sources of heat.  Place it where no one is likely to sit right next to it, away from radiators, and away from direct sunlight.  If you can, avoid having it directly next to a window or external wall, especially if the walls are stone.  Near the centre of a space is usually best.

It can be hard to remember where you put the sensor unit - one easy way is to take a picture on your phone.  Then if you forget, you'll know exactly where to look.

If you have more than one space you want to monitor, you can move your sensor unit around.  Collect at least two weeks of representative data from each.  It's helpful to do this in all four seasons, but you won't be able to do that during the course of the supported programme.
