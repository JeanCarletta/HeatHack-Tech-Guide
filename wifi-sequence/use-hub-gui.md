You should now see the hub's interface.  Choose "Configure Wifi", and choose the venue's guest wifi network from the list.  If you don't see it, refresh the list by choosing "Scan".  Then enter the wifi password and choose "Save".

Some venues deliberately hide the wifi network - in this case you can type in its name (SSID).  You may be able to look up the name using a phone you have used on the wifi before or find it on the back of the router. 

If after you save the password, heathack disappears from your list of connections, the hub is now successfully connected to the internet.   Otherwise you may have entered the wrong password - please try again.
