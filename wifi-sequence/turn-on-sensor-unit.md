Now turn on the sensor unit.  

The faint blue LED on the hub will flash every time it receives data from the sensor unit.  This is useful for checking that the radio on the sensor unit can reach the hub.
When the sensor unit is first turned on, it sends data to the hub every 10 seconds for 2 minutes.   If you can't see it flash even in low light levels, make sure the arrows on the cases point towards each other and if you have to, move them closer together.

After two minutes, the sensor sends readings less frequently, usually every five minutes.
